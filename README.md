# ANNA

## About

ANNA is a full system simulator/emulator framework in Java. It was created to replace ATLAS, a simulator framework used for lectures at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. ANNA stands for ANNA is Not the New ATLAS as the approach taken in ANNA was dynamic loading rather than creating a custom language. ANNA was also supposed to provide an interactive GUI with the possibility of visualizing embedded systems.

The team:
- Boran Car
- Marko Ivanković
- Ivan Krišto

## Status

The team considers the project abandonded and recommends using SystemC as a more general purpose framework for constructing embedded system simulators.
